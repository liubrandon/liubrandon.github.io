> ## Abstract
> The island of Singapore has grown significantly through the use of land reclamation, with its landmass expanding nearly 25% since Sir Stamford Raffles arrived in 1822. British colonizers of Singapore reclaimed land with relatively limited scope — to recreate the physical environment and to maintain colonial order. In post-colonial Singapore, the People's Action Party has deployed land reclamation on a massive scale — creating public housing, promoting industry, facilitating maritime trade — and in the process, becoming one of the most livable cities in the world. Led by Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, land reclamation is closely tied to national ambition. Recent history of land reclamation in Singapore has been distinctly state-driven, and its physical transformation highlights the tensions between environmental degradation and uplifting of the masses.

## Introduction

When asked to characterize the "ingredients of a good city" in a 2012 interview, Lee Kuan Yew drew upon his memories of world travels. The ideal city should be unpolluted, free of the fumes he had smelled from chemical factories in Osaka, and the soot from lorries in Malaysia. It should create a sense of safety, unlike how he had felt walking in New York City's Central Park. Its streets should be uncongested, unlike Bangkok's; its buildings uncrowded, leaving space for greenery, unlike Hong Kong's.[^1] In so many words, Singapore's founding father took pride in the many negative things that the city-state was decidedly not. One can imagine that, once Singapore had gained its independence from Britain and separated from Malaysia in 1965, a younger Lee saw the country as a clean slate — an island to be rebuilt and transformed into the ideal city he so clearly envisioned.

Indeed, to become what it is today, the island of Singapore has physically transformed an impressive amount. From the point of Sir Stamford Raffles' arrival in 1819, Singapore's landmass has increased by nearly 25 percent through the creation of new coastal land reclaimed from swamplands and the sea.[^2] The vast majority of land reclamation has been undertaken in the post-colonial state, for housing, industry, and recreation.[^3] Singapore's southeastern shore exemplifies this, with 4,885 hectares or nearly 50 square kilometers added in the four decades after independence.[^4] Today, a visitor could deplane in Changi International Airport, drive past high-rise public housing on the East Coast Parkway, arrive in the central business district for a meeting, spend a night in the Marina Bay Sands, lounge at the East Coast Park beach the next day, return to the Changi and depart Singapore, all while unknowingly and exclusively on reclaimed land.

The Singaporean case of land reclamation merits serious consideration as its limits may soon be approaching. In its latest Master Plan, Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority focuses less on additional reclamations and more on innovative approaches for new underground spaces. So, the island may soon expand downward, rather than outward, as it faces rising sea levels. As Singapore and all nations face the challenges of building sustainable cities and addressing climate change, the "ingredients of a good city" also become more complex. Thus, in the context of climate resiliency, understanding the Singaporean case of long-term reclamation and land use planning may be useful and important for other island nations and cities around the world.

This paper explores land reclamation in Singapore from the lenses of environmental history, nation-building, and trade. Bringing together state narratives, local environmental histories, and the transnational sand trade in conversation shows how Singapore's skill for planning and its many reclamation projects have shaped the city-state and its surrounding region. Like in Debjani Bhattacharyya's scholarship of Kolkata but in its own way, Singapore also possesses a "history of forgetting" — erasing mangroves, coral reefs, and coastal kampongs (villages) in favor of packed sand to provide public housing and promote economic development.[^5] Many of Singapore's signature successes, and some of its present challenges, are borne out of its sheer capacity to reimagine and recreate its physical environment. The story of land reclamation in Singapore highlights the complexities of environmental degradation when conducted by the state; it challenges the typical narrative that destruction of the environment is driven by greed and profit for a small number. Rather, land reclamation was a key lever in Singapore's process of decolonization and pursuit of its dreams of a better future for its citizens.

## Colonial Foundations: Trade and Social Order

Singapore's first documented land reclamation had the dual purpose of facilitating trade and promoting the social order desired by the British. In 1822, at the behest of Raffles, roughly 300 Chinese, Malay, and Tamil "coolie" laborers were paid a wage of one rupee a day to raze a small hill and transport the material to fill the mangrove swamp at the southern bank at the mouth of the Singapore River. Famed Malayan writer Munshi Abdullah described the spectacle of the months-long project in his autobiography: "[The laborers] were told to dig away the earth and carry it off... there were some men breaking the rocks, for there were a great many large rocks there, and everyone had work to do; there were dozens of overseers, and it all looked like people at war."[^6]

Raffles' Place, as the new land came to be known, provided more space for not just godowns, or warehouses, for ships to load and store cargo, but also kampongs segregated on ethnic lines by the British's plans. In his account of Singapore's history of land reclamation, Miles Powell observes that this "[racial] segregation... was a crucial component of the ordered landscape colonists used reclamation to help achieve."[^7] Ironically, the land jointly created by Chinese, Malay, and Tamil laborers served to segregate their communities.

Both Singapore's population and importance as an entrepôt continued to grow through the 19th century. The British found inexpensive labor migrant inflows from China, India, Southeast Asian countries, seeking opportunity in the free port city and often fleeing poverty in their home countries.[^8] The advent of steamships, which required deeper berths than the Singapore River could provide, prompted the establishment of New Harbour on the southwest coast in 1852 (known as Keppel Harbour since 1900).[^9]

In 1869, the opening of the Suez Canal enabled a rapid acceleration in steamship traffic. By opening a waterway through the Red Sea and bypassing the circuitous journey around the African Cape, the Suez Canal cut travel time between Europe and Asia by one-third.[^10] The impact of this in Singapore was immediate; in the one year following the opening of the Suez Canal, trade volume through Singapore increased by 55 percent.[^11] Spurred on by their desire to create an environment conducive to growing trade and commerce, the colonial government in total added roughly 300 hectares to the island of Singapore, largely to improve connectivity to the harbors and build military facilities and an airport.[^12] The technological advances and increasing economic connectivity of the 19th and early 20th centuries cemented Singapore's centrality to trade in the British empire and established a precedent for the island's continued expansion.

## Post-Colonial Transformation: Housing, Industry, and National Development

In post-colonial Singapore, both the role and scale of land reclamation projects have expanded dramatically. Since becoming independent in 1965, Singapore has added more than 14,420 hectares of land, 48 times the total amount colonial Singapore did.[^13] Both colonial and post-colonial Singapore share the desire to strengthen its situation as a trading hub, but the driving motivation fundamentally changed. The British expanded Singapore to advance imperial aims, to provide an "ordered, sanitary, landscape… conducive to trade and commerce," and were not so much concerned about the livelihoods of their subjects.[^14] But under the People's Action Party (PAP), post-colonial Singapore made advancing the nation's economic status and improving Singaporean citizens' living standards its paramount goal.

### Industrial Development

In the southwest of Singapore, the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) and Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) (renamed Maritime and Port Authority [MPA] in 1995) undertook vast reclamation efforts to further develop the city state's industrial and port activities. Beginning in 1963 and through the late 1980s, the JTC reclaimed roughly 2,700 hectares of Singapore's rural west to raise the Jurong Industrial Site and expansion in Tuas, flattening the once hilly jungle and using that material to fill in swampland to do so.[^15]

The historical islands off the southwestern have been described as "lost," their mangrove forests eliminated, residents resettled, and coastlines expanded to make room for chemical refineries, factories, and deep seaports. Jurong Island is the starkest example, created by merging seven smaller islands together in the 1990s and 2000s.[^16] Today, as the Ministry of Trade and Industry writes, Jurong Island is "the heart of Singapore's energy and chemicals industry, ...home to almost 100 leading global petroleum, petrochemicals, and specialty chemical companies."[^17]

### Public Housing and the HDB

Alongside the development of ports and industry, the need for housing was a crucial driver for land reclamation in post-colonial Singapore. In 1960, the HDB was created to replace the colonial-era Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT), whose public housing initiatives struggled to keep pace with a growing population with many living in squalid, crowded conditions. The 1947 Census Report lamented Singapore's density, which would worsen with the post-war baby boom: "about a third of the population is living, not scattered over the 200 square miles of the island, but herded into about 1,000 acres in the heart of the city."[^31]

Outside of the urban core, wealthy Europeans and locals held large estates while the majority resided in kampongs with farmland.[^32] An estimated 100,000+ squatters lived in "huts made of attap, old boxes, rusty corrugated iron, etc. with no sanitation, water or any of the elementary health requirements."[^33] By 1958, the SIT estimated that 16,000 new homes would be needed annually to keep up with the current rate of population increase, but over the entire span of its existence, it had built just 23,000 units.[^34]

The Singapore government has used the HDB as a powerful lever for its social and economic goals. Where Raffles had used land reclamation to divide races, Lee Kuan Yew used it to deliberately mix Singapore's ethnic groups. Lee saw the creation of brand new HDB flats as an opportunity to reverse the British order that "prevented [races] from congregating," and instead guarantee that the new HDBs would be racially integrated.[^38]

To reach the level of success that it has, the HDB has relied, quite literally, upon reclaimed land as the foundation for its communities. Since its inception, the HDB has been responsible for the reclamation of 3,915.3 hectares of land, a figure that approaches a third of the total increase in Singapore's land area.[^41]

### Local Voices and Community Impact

Unfortunately, the voices of those most impacted by government reclamation projects are often the least common in the historical record. One account, from Siglap on the east coast, helps to explain the scope and nature of the impact of government reclamation schemes on Singapore's fishing villages.

In 1976, the Siglap Community Youth Group published the 64-page Report on the Fishermen of Siglap, the culmination of interviews with all 100 remaining fishermen in Kampong Siglap, Kampong Hajijah, Kampong Lim Choo, and Kampong Goh Choo. As it turns out, by the time of the study, the majority of fishermen interviewed no longer fished as their primary occupation; 49 out of the 100 had retired, were unemployed, or changed occupations, and another 14 only fished part-time.[^23]

> "My father, myself and my children were all born in this very house in Kampong Hajijah, which was originally known as Kampong Bahru. My grandfather came from Johore and my grandmother migrated from Sumatra… Fishing has always been a family trade which was handed down by my forefathers. I started my fishing career in a kelong at the age of thirteen… I fished practically every day, except during the very stormy periods. The work was hard, the hours long. But I was a good fisherman. I knew all the good fishing grounds off Siglap and Bedok… The fisherfolk in Siglap called me a 'Pawang' — a magical expert, though I really did not possess any magical powers. I used my brain, skill and experience effectively."[^24]

## The Transnational Sand Trade

As much as the Singapore story of land reclamation is about nation-building, it also has had unmistakable transnational effects through the regional sand trade. As early as 1978, shortages of fill material for reclamation were reported in Singapore. A Business Times article in June of that year described the Singapore government's collaboration with a seven-man team of Japanese experts to find viable ocean sand deposits as a "hunt," as if searching for buried treasure.[^51]

As Singapore also began to run out of inland hills to demolish, developers increasingly turned toward imported sand to provide fill material.[^52] By the 1980s, local dredging companies looked to Indonesia and Malaysia for sources for sand, especially from nearby islands such as Batam.[^53]

The purchase and import of sand for reclamation projects are left to the private companies contracted by the Singapore government and not made public at a granular level, and over time, many of Singapore's neighbors did not welcome this trade. In 2002, 50 Malaysian fishermen staged a protest on the Tebrau Strait between Singapore and Johor, demanding compensation for the lost income from fish that they perceived to have been scared away by Singapore's coastal expansions.[^54]

According to data from the UN, between 2007-2016, Singapore reported importing 27.62 million metric tons of sand from Myanmar, but for the same period, Myanmar reported exporting just 2.2 million metric tons to Singapore.[^57] From Cambodia during that period, Singapore reported importing 80.33 million metric tons while Cambodian figures put that figure at just 2.77 million metric tons.[^58] Today, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia all have instituted bans on sand exports to Singapore.[^59]

## Conclusion: Looking Forward

For Singapore, land reclamation is inextricably tied with national ambition. In many ways, the vast additions to its islands and shores have become societal yardsticks with which the Singaporean government measures its success. Post-colonial Singapore's environmental transformations have been distinctly state-driven. They are capitalistic, too, spurring private companies' importation of sand and raw materials, construction, the growth of industries, and multinational corporations' investments on new grounds. But ultimately it was through the JTC, HDB, and MPA, that Singapore meticulously charted out its plans for its land, allocated prodigious amounts of capital, and commenced construction in great feats of nation-building — particularly for such a small city-state.

Like many other Asian nations during the "Great Acceleration," modern Singapore has exploited and augmented its natural environment for the sake of improving its citizens' lives in ways that its colonial government never previously permitted. As the history of land reclamation in Singapore is still being written, it leaves many open questions. For starters: with virtually all of Singapore's original coastlines erased, to what extent is it possible for pre-reclamation ecosystems to recover and coexist? Sand is a non-renewable resource; will new materials and techniques be able to replace Singapore's reliance on it?

With Singapore's wealth and its capacity to grow and protect itself, what does equity look like, particularly in the age of global climate change? If only "some islands will rise" — as Matthew Schneider-Mayerson has noted — what is Singapore's role as its drastically poorer or less prepared peers face similar threats?[^64] In simplest terms, it's still not clear whether a ceaselessly expanding Singapore is sustainable.

Perhaps this question has already been answered; at a bare minimum, there are clear harms to the welfare of those in reclamation's path, both at home and abroad. However, the story of land reclamation in Singapore is unique in that it challenges the typical narrative of environmental degradation — that it is driven by greed and profit for the few. Instead, given Singapore's will and capacity for environmental pragmatism to uplift the masses, precisely how the state will navigate the real trade-offs presented by land reclamation is a question worth asking as the island continues to grow.
