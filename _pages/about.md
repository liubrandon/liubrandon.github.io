![dp](../images/dp.jpg){:width="305px" style="float:right; margin-left:1em;"} I am a junior at Yale University studying Computer Science, and this is my personal blog.

Some of my interests include points/miles travel, computing, technology, and entreupreneurship â€” I write about these topics ocassionally.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the [Yale Efficient Computing Lab](http://yecl.org/) with Lin Zhong. I hope the posts I share here may help out other students, researchers, or professionals trying to learn similar things that I've been interested in/worked on.

You can find this blog's source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/liubrandon/liubrandon.github.io), and my other social  links are below.
