My name is Brandon Liu, and I'm a junior at Yale University studying Computer Science. I hope the posts I share here may help out other students, researchers, or professionals trying to learn similar things that I've been interested in/worked on.

My blog is built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll), and you can find its full source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/liubrandon/liubrandon.github.io).
