![Me in Granada in 2019](../images/brandonliu-about.jpg){:.img-right} I am a junior at Yale University studying Computer Science, and this is my personal blog.

Some of my interests include points/miles travel, food/drink, personal finance, computing, software development, and entrepreneurship.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the [Yale Efficient Computing Lab](http://yecl.org/) headed by Lin Zhong. Previously, I was Restaurant Critic for the [Yale Daily News](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/author/brandonliu/) and covered New Haven food and drink.

You can find this blog's source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/liubrandon/liubrandon.github.io), and my other social links are below.
