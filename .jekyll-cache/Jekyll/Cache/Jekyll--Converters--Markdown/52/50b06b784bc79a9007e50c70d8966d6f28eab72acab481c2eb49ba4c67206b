I"ê<p>This summer, Iâ€™ve had the great pleasure to work as a Research Assistant to Prof. Lin Zhong at the <a href="http://yecl.org/">Yale Efficient Computing Lab</a>. The project that I have been contributing to is <a href="https://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~jianding/">Jian Ding</a>â€™s work to develop software for real-time massive MIMO baseband processing, work typically done by specialized hardware such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>s.</p>
