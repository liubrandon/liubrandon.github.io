I"<p>This summer, I’ve had the great pleasure to work as a Research Assistant to Prof. Lin Zhong at the <a href="http://yecl.org/">Yale Efficient Computing Lab</a>. The project that I have been contributing to is related to 5G and in particular, massive multiple-input multiple-output technology (MIMO). Massive MIMO involves using multiple antennas at the transmitter and reciever to improve throughput and spectral efficiency — it’s seen as a key technology to enabling the transition to 5G mobile networks.</p>
